# balance-scale-weights-python
============================
an algorithmic solution in python to an interesting brain teaser regarding weights on a scale

### Problem:
Suppose you have a weight on one side of a scale. 
Given an array of other weights, see if the scale will balance. 
You can use weights on either side, and you don't have to use all the weights.

### Rules:
+ Direct matching balance allowed
+ Addition of weights in array to balance allowed

### Usage
Use the problem_balance_weights.py file
